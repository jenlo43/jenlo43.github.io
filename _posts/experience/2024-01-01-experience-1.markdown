description: Designed and developed a serverless architecture using AWS services including Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 to track the performance of a new auto-arrive feature. Then processed the JSON data by comparing the manual and and the new automated status updates. Developed a Python script to compare these performances and help identify issues such as having overlapping points of arrival for different customers and proposed algorithmic parameters that can be tuned to address these issues. Worked with both the frontend and backend team to resolve bugs and program new client requirements and improvements. 
technologies: AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB,S3, Kinesis Streams, Cloudwatch, SAM), Node.js, TypeScript, Python, Gitlab, HTML
