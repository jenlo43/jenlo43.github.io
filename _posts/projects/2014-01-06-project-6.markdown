client: Medical Image segmentation using UNet 
category: CNN
name: Medical Image Segmentation Using UNet
description: Implemented the UNet CNN architecture at 3 different depths, 3,4,and 5. The models were trained on Polyp and Pneumothorax medical images separately. The performace of the medical image segmentations were evaluated based on the Intersection over Union (IoU). UNet with a depth of 4 had the best performance both in training and testing IoU.
