client: Control Using Different Inverse Kinematics Methods for Trajectories
category: Robotics
name: Control of Robotic Arm Using Inverse Kinematics
description: Designed a 4-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm in Matlab. Implemented the inverse kinematics algorithm to estimate the path of 3 different trajectories. Analyzed the effect of the trajectories and their complexity based on the performace of the path taken.
technologies: Matlab with Robotics Toolbox
